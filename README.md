# Challenge 1 - Accessible Website (Horiseon)

In this project we were asked to refactor exisitng code to meet a certain set of standards.
This task is a common task for front-end developers and junior developers.

In this project we had to assume a marketing agency hired me to refactor an exisitng site to make it more Accessible.
